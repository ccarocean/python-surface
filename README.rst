surface - computations on z = f(x, y) surfaces
----------------------------------------------

.. begin-description

The `surface` package provides representations for surfaces that are proper
functions of x and y.  These can be defined numerically or by symbolic
functions.  It also provides computations on these surfaces, including surface
fitting and finding extrema (**FUTURE**).
